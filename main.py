# =============================================================================


# ------------------------------- Module Imports ------------------------------
# Standard lib - access CLI scripting for inputting user commands.
import os
import shutil
import subprocess

# To parse command-line arguments for the non-interactive CLI mode.
import argparse

# Regular expressions - validate a manually-entered MAC address.
import re

# Randomly choose a hex (or nibble) for each figure of the new MAC address.
import random


# ------------------------------- Named Constant -------------------------------
# Matches the two MAC address formats ip/ifconfig actually accept: six
# hex-digit pairs separated by colons, or by hyphens (not mixed).

)

# Where the kernel exposes each network interface's current MAC
# address - the same path the README's own `real_mac.txt` backup
# command reads from. A module-level constant (rather than hardcoding
# the path in each function) so tests can point it at a fake directory
# instead of the real /sys.
SYSFS_NET_PATH = '/sys/class/net'

# Where original MAC addresses are backed up, one "interface,mac" pair
# per line, keyed by interface name (only ever the *true* original -
# see write_backup()'s "only write once per interface" rule in main).
# A module-level constant so tests can point it at a scratch file
# instead of the real one.
BACKUP_FILE = 'real_mac.txt'

# Where recent MAC changes are logged, so the *last* change can be
# undone specifically - distinct from BACKUP_FILE, which only ever
# remembers the very first (true original) value. Same "interface,mac"
# format, but multiple lines per interface are expected: each line is
# one past value, oldest first.
