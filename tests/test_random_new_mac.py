"""Tests for main.random_new_mac() and main.make_locally_administered().

Regression coverage for the headline bug found during review: the
original random-MAC generator's own docstring acknowledged that it
"may come up with an error message ... just re-run the program until
no error occurs" - a fully random first octet has its multicast bit
set on ~50% of possible byte values, and a multicast address is never
valid as a NIC's own MAC. make_locally_administered() fixes this by
construction; these tests confirm that fix rather than just
re-asserting the old "sometimes fails" behaviour.
